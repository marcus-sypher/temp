                      This bottling from a vineyard near Highway 101 is driven by an intense minerality, boasting damp earth and crushed rock aromas alongside lime pith. The palate is marvelously stony in both flavor and texture, sizzling with yellow-grapefruit and more high-toned citrus flavors.                      Matt Kettmann ",Olsen Prunetucky Sands,null,"

                      This superrich and mouthcoating wine is also silky in texture and has a light, lifting acidity to give it great balance. Poached pears, marzipan and a touch of butter give it full flavors to pair with sauteed fish, broiled shellfish or to savor by itself.                      Jim Gordon ",Cuvée Number Five,null,"
