                      Could Merlot be the true gem of the warmer areas of the Santa Cruz Mountains? This bottling says s, showing red cherry, woodpsice and minty herb aromas on the nose. The palate clings to a firm tannic frame, offering umami-laced flavors of soy, herb, red fruit and baking spice. Drink now-2032.                      Matt Kettmann ",Gist Ranch Estate,null,"

                      While the wine's raspberry, lilac and lemon aromas are pretty, its earthy petrichor/ozone note is hard to resist. Look for flavors like Bing cherries and lemonade mixed in with black tea, caramel, and rosemary. Firm tannins with a decent bit of acidity and rich mouthfeel.

                      The wine's blueberries, cherry blossom, lemon basil and honeycomb aromas make for a beautiful introduction. Flavors of cherry fruit leather, orange sorbet and black tea are rich and satisfying. This nicely balanced wine possesses a slippery mouthfeel, soft tannins and a long finish.

                      A richly textured wine, with super floral aromas of lilac and wild roses joining black cherries, cedar and pipe tobacco. Lush, concentrated blackberry and dark plum flavors glide over the palate. This Merlot is hedonistic and enjoyable.                      Michael Alberty ",null,null,"

                      There is already a good balance in this wine. Ripe tannins and black currant fruits co-exist easily with the overall smokiness of the wine. It shows potential. Drink from 2024.                      Roger Voss ",Terre Océane,Misa Imports,"

                      Charred cherry and fresh berry meet with roasted meat aromas on the nose of this bottling. There's a peppery spice to the palate, where black plum and purple flowers make for an easygoing sip.                      Matt Kettmann ",null,null,"
