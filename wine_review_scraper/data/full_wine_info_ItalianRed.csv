                      This bottling of a very uncommon grape for California is dedicated to the late vintner Ron Siletto. Intense aromas of fresh currant and cranberry kick off the nose, while the palate shows snappy strawberry and white pepper flavors, leading into a minty finish.

                      A censer is a vessel used for burning incense, typically in religious ceremonies. It is a perfect name for this wine given its transcendent nature. Aromas and flavors of cherries, violets, wet rattan and the contents of a schoolhouse chalk tray encircle your head and psyche. It has a massive tannic structure.

                      This wild and funky wine is a joy. Aromas suggest watermelon juice, game and dried roses. The palate is similar to a sour beer but livelier, with tart wild berries and an earthy finish.                      Jeff Porter ",Phermento Lambrusco Rifermentato in Bottiglia,Kobrand,"

                      Baked black plum, toasted wood and fennel-pollen aromas decorate the nose on this bottling of a promising grape for this region. Charred wood leads the palate, where roasted cherry and boysenberry converge for a bold expression.                      Matt Kettmann ",null,null,"

                      Lovely strawberry aromas are dusted in cinnamon bark and sandalwood on the dynamic nose of this bottling. Zesty cherry flavors ride a lingering acidity on the palate, as licorice adds a touch of spice.                      Matt Kettmann ",Vienza,null,"
