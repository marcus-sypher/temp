                      Aromas of green pear, tangerine and jasmine pave the way for flavors of yellow apple, lemon zest, vanilla, rose petal and a touch of nutmeg. This wine is creamy on the palate and offers a final note of mineral-rich salinity.                      Mike DeSimone ",Tradition Grand Selection,"Croatian Premium Wine Imports, Inc","

                      Aligoté is a hidden gem of Burgundy so it's a super jewel in this epic vineyard between Hollister, Salinas and nowhere. Wet stone and delicately honeyed lily bulb aromas lead into a brisk palate of tight green apple, lime and alluring cement.                      Matt Kettmann ",Sunset Block Siletto Vineyard,null,"

                      Light yellow to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of Valencia orange, white peach and honeysuckle. It feels good on the palate, offering flavors of lemon, nectarine and orange blossom that culminate in a bright finish.

                      Aromas of apricot preserves, ripe summer peach and crumbled sage prep the palate for flavors of nectarine, clementine, dried Mediterranean herbs and a touch of flintiness that lingers on the palate after the last sip.

                      Petite Arvine, a white grape originating from the Swiss region of Valais, is a rarity in the US. What a discovery it is—richly hued with a deep golden yellow and an intensity of aromas and flavors to match: lemon, lime, ripe yellow apple and peach, dewy grass, chamomile, nasturtium leaf and nectar, and a subtle blanched almond nuttiness in the back-palate. Lovely now on its own, versatile enough to pair with a variety of dishes, but this is an example of a white wine that can also age with elegance and grace.

                      This is a gift to the jaded palate. Lightning bolts of acidity awaken you to aromas of a lemon granita matched with pine needles and chalky talc. This tangy dazzler seals the deal, with tangy citrus, pineapple and saline flavors. It was aged eight months in stainless steel and neutral French oak, with malolactic fermentation naturally in barrel.                      Michael Alberty ",Owens Vineyard,null,"
