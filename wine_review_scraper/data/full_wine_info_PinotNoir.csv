                      Luscious, deep black-fruit flavors light up this stunning, concentrated and delicious wine that conveys power with polish. Black cherries, black currants, spearmint and pine boughs are just a few of the flavor elements that flood the palate while being supported beautifully by moderate tannins and balancing acidity. Best from 2025â€“2032.                      Jim Gordon ",Rayhill Vineyard,null,"

                      This is the first stab at the increasingly legendary vineyard for this iconic winery, and the results are fantastic. Deep, lavish aromas of black plum, violet and chai spice show on the nose. The bold, spicy and rich palate picks up chalky tannins and zesty acidity, proving intense but balanced.                      Matt Kettmann ",Radian Vineyard,null,"

                      A classic expression of Pinot Noir, with the juicy cherry flavor that is beautifully expressed against velvety texture, vibrant structure and dense harmony of tannins. Mineral and spice accents add depth and charm, before the acidity comes in a second wave and leaves a mouthwatering impression on the finish. Drink now through 2035.

                      Lively, focused black fruit, bay and redwood aromas lead to just-ripe black cherries, blueberries and black tea in this well-concentrated, well-balanced and complex wine. Good acidity and moderate tannins complement the vivid flavors and bode well for further aging. Best from 2025-2032.                      Jim Gordon ",Sun Chase Vineyard Estate Grown,null,"

                      Crisp and pure aromas of pomegranate extract, crushed stone and Red Hot candies show on the vivid nose of this block-designated bottling. The palate is generous in cherry but vibrant in sumac-laced acidity, as a zippy acidity flies into the finish. Drink now through 2038.

                      The nose on this single-vineyard expression from a higher elevation vineyard in the middle of the appellation is dark, ripe, elegant and serious, showing strawberry, raspberry jam and violet aromas with a hint of cocoa. Powdery tannins frame the ripe flavors of black cherry, cola and freshly smashed currant on the palate.                      Matt Kettmann ",Rita's Crown Vineyard,null,"
