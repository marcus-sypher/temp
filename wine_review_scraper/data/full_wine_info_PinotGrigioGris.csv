                      This is a Pinot Gris made with intention. The amber-hued Alium, with 40 days of maceration, dazzles the eye while aromas of dried apricots, peach skins and chalk dust spout poetry. Tart kiwi, walnuts, and herbs like oregano and thyme paint a savory flavor masterpiece. Enjoy now until 2032.                      Michael Alberty ",Alium,null,"

                      This pale coppery pour gives off gentle aromas of grass and apricot, like an ode to summer. It's all stone fruit on the palate, too. Plush in texture and ripe with juicy notes, the wine is reined in by zippy acidity and an earthy characteristic like white button mushrooms. The finish is long, with restrained stone fruit flavors, and you'll want to spend some time with it.                      Layla Schlack ",Orange,Grape Expectations (CA),"

                      In this wine, sweet pear aromas merge with a crisp saline scent. The palate is inflected with a creamy, slightly waxy texture that's not all that typical, but provides a welcome counterpoint to bright, lemon-drop acidity. A savory note of aged cheese leads into a long, tangy finish.                      Layla Schlack ",Réserve,Quintessential Wines,"

                      The color of a flaming sunset, this orange wine, made from Pinot Gris, opens with hedonistic aromas of ginger, candied pineapple, nectarine and marmalade, backed by honeyed flower-blossom scents and the slightest mushroomy funk to remind you that we're not in Kansas anymore, Toto. The palate crackles and pops with tangy flavor. There's a pithy, tannic tug on the tongue, mouthwatering acidity and a lengthy finish. Clean, ripe and fresh, this is just plain delicious.                      Christina Pickard ",Orange,Pyramid Valley Vineyards LLC,"
