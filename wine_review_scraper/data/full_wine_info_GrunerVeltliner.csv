                      What a classic expression of Grüner Veltliner from the Wachau! This shows pedigree, combining vivacity, richness and elegance. Its firm structure is decorated with notes of cardamom, bergamot and thyme, underscored by bright acidity, while its silky texture adds extra charm. Nicely balanced from start to finish, it is showing beautifully now, but has the verve to age deliciously. Drink now–2041.

                      This blockbuster Grüner is rich and expressive, yet incredibly vivacious and graceful. Aromas and flavors of orchard and stone fruit mingle at the core, framed by floral notes and a hint of white pepper. Its intense acidity cuts through the meaty profile, bringing out harmony, which makes this white a pleasure to drink now, but also makes it a great wine to put in your cellar.

                      This is a bit reserved today, but it is just waiting to unravel, as there is a great tension between its structure, acidity and floral and fruit elements. It is lighter in style, showing vivacity and complexity, featuring notes of quince and elderflower. Patience will be rewarded with this one. Best after 2025.

                      This wine is intense, with loads of white pepper and spice upfront, paving the way for Bosc pear and white tea accents. Acidity, although powerful, is very well integrated and acts as both the fuel and backbone, giving energy to the overall experience. The finish is tactile and long.

                      There is a sense of vivacity and originality to this Grüner that we don't see too often. It is slightly cloudy, its texture is silky yet crunchy, and the flavors of apricot, elderflower and clementine lead to sip after sip.
