                      AÂ beautiful mix of fruit and flowers waft out of the glass: cherry and apple blossom, lime leaf and pith, Meyer lemon juice and mandarin orange zest. On the palate, find a subtle of phenolic grip adds just a touch of texture and a bit of weight to this otherwise light-bodied white wine. The finish is clean, crisp and invites another sip (and then another).                      Jim Gordon ",null,null,"
