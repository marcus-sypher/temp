                      Clean lines of peach custard and orange blossom are fresh on the nose of this bottling from a mountaintop site on the north end of this small appellation. A chalky minerality and brisk acidity fire up the palate, which offers nectarine and melon bubblegum flavors.                      Matt Kettmann ",Purisima Mountain Vineyard,null,"

                      This is a very racy and tight expression of Viognier, starting with aromas of lemon rind and young coconut flesh on the nose. A chalky texture frames the palate, where restrained tropical fruit flavors emerge.                      Matt Kettmann ",Escolle Vineyard,null,"

                      This extended skin-contact gem smells like the kitchen after peeling pecks of peaches. The peaches are joined by bergamot, dried apricots and pine needles. It's medium bodied, with modest acidity, velvety tannins and a chalky texture. Aged for 10 months in neutral acacia puncheons, this is ready to enjoy now through 2031.

                      This is a thoroughly enjoyable medium-bodied Viognier, with a smooth, elegant texture. White peaches, toasted filberts and maple candy form an able trio on the nose, followed by flavors of cantaloupe, honeycomb and pineapple upside-down cake. It was aged in neutral French oak.                      Michael Alberty ",24K Soloro Vineyard,null,"

                      This varietal Viognier has a pleasant elevated acidity that complements the grape's natural glossy texture.
