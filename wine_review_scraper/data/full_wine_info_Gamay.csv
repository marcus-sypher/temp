                      This wine is a true celebration of Beaujolais. Powerful black fruits are accompanied by dense tannins that still need time to soften. This wine is impressively rich, softened by some wood aging. It will mature well, so drink from 2025.                      Roger Voss ",Le Moulin,Kobrand,"

                      A firm and textured wine, this has ripe black fruits over solid tannins. The wine is rich and concentrated, to be expected from old bush vines. It will age well, so wait to drink until 2025.                      Roger Voss ",Les Vignes Centenaires,International Wines,"
