                      This outstanding wine delivers a bedazzling perfume of boysenberries and black cherries, with touches of leather, tobacco and peonies. Its velvety texture and slick acidity are perfect foils for concentrated blackberry and tangy mulberry fruit flavors joined by a bit of honey drizzled on corn bread. BBQ ribs, anyone?                      Michael Alberty ",Lonely Heart,null,"

                      This estate-grown wine is a great find and a great value. Rich black fruits and intricate oak spices form a compelling blend in this well-saturated, deep and complex wine. Moderate to full tannins support blueberries, new leather and ginger flavors that expand on the palate and linger on the finish. It will be best from 2027–2037.

                      This young, firm and muscular wine wraps vivid black fruits in significant, sandy tannins that will need time to resolve for full appreciation of its potent blackberry, blueberry and black-pepper flavors. Best from 2027–2037.                      Jim Gordon ",Reserve,null,"

                      This bold and beautiful 100% estate Cabernet Sauvignon rested for 28 months in 100% new French oak. Dark raspberry and chocolate aromas are joined by notes of vanilla and cedar. Rich black cherry, espresso, almonds and fig flavors are backed by grippy tannins. Wait until 2024 to open.                      Michael Alberty ",Tenuta,null,"

                      The experience of this bottling is deliciously predictable vintage to vintage, serving as a rich and reliable expression of Paso Robles Cab. Aromas of black-cherry compote, caramel and clove remain fresh on the nose. The palate's smooth tannins wrap lusciously around fudge, more compote and baking-spice flavors, leading into a gingerbread finish.                      Matt Kettmann ",null,null,"

5,14.7%,"Santa Cruz Mountains, Central Coast, California, US",750 ml,Red, US,5/1/2023,"
                      There's a pure streak of darkly detailed yet fresh red fruit on the nose of the bottling, which is layered in aromas of wood and cocoa spice. The palate is wrapped in a sappy grip that will soften with time, as flavors of mahogany, black pepper and blackberry align atop persistent acidity. Drink now-2039.
