                      Light red or a dark rosé, this is on you to decide, as this white transcends boundaries of classification. Rather, it redefines the variety of Sankt Laurent, showing essentially, a dark brooding side, filled with dark cherry and violet, and  a light, vibrant and mouthwatering side with white raspberry and tamarind. Beautiful texture, too.                      Aleks Zecevic ",Numen Sankt Laurent,Field Blend Selections,"

                      Bucking the rosé stereotypes, this 100% Zinfandel is packed fully of earthy savoriness. Florals lead the aromas with notes of rose petals, jasmine and cherry blossom, followed by delicate scents of white peach and just-ripe nectarine skins. The palate has just a touch of tannic texture along with a kind of dusty, sandy minerality that's just intriguing. Interesting, fun and just plain delicious. A must try for sure.

                      Temecula is not known as a land of rose, but this blend of 55% Pinot Gris and 45% Pinot Noir is a promising recipe. A rusty pink in the glass, the nose pops with muddled cherry, strawberry and wet stone aromas. The palate is fresh with red apple, cherry skin and blood orange flavors.

                      Ever sit in the front row of a Gallagher show? You will get more watermelon from this wine. My favorite summertime fruit is joined on the nose by basil and cantaloupe, with traces of guava. The wine's acidity vibrates as grapefruit and raspberry hard candy flavors bounce about the palate.                      Michael Alberty ",Sangiovese,null,"

                      An alluring bubblegum color in the glass, this Pinot Noir bottling mixes chalk, strawberry and crisp pomegranate on the nose. It's sharply effervescent on the palate, where citrus and light red fruit flavors ride an aggressive foam.                      Matt Kettmann ",Petillant Naturel Sparkling,null,"

                      Rusty earth and dried cherry aromas show on the nose of this bottling. There's ample zip to the sip, where zippy flavors of red fruit meet with a dusty rock minerality.                      Matt Kettmann ",null,null,"
