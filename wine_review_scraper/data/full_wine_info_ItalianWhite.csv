                      This medium-yellow wine has aromas of apricot, lemon and herbes de Provence. Full mouthfeel and flavors of white peach, orange marmalade, butterscotch and a soft touch of lavender that lingers into the smooth finish make for a satisfying pour.

                      A golden hue in the glass, this lightly cloudy bottling offers apple blossom, damp grass, green almond and wet stone aromas on the highly unique nose. There's a wet concrete and green fruit flavor to the palate, where the palate extends across lingering tannins.                      Matt Kettmann ",Calleri Vineyard,null,"

                      Macerated for over 28 days, this golden-hued wine jumps out of the bottle with aromas of spiced dried apricots, roasted honey, dried yellow flowers and dried earth. The palate is rich and full in body, with a nuttiness mixed with dried peach flavors. The wine finishes with exotic spice and dried floral notes. Drink now–2030.

                      Raccaro has made wine in the heart of the Collio since 1928, producing bottlings of place and beauty ever since. Aromas of apricot, white peach and magnolia spill out the moment you pull the cork. The focused palate dances between showing off the intense minerality of their vineyards and the vibrant fresh fruit flavors that drive the wine. It finishes with balanced acidity, keeping each sip fresh. This wine ages very well so drink now through 2035.                      Jeff Porter ",Rolat,Jan D'Amore Wines,"

                      This wine is one of the standard bearers of Malvasia in the Collio. Elegant aromas of white peach, jasmine, magnolia, crushed rock and fresh herbs all ebb and flow with each whiff of the glass. Pine and fresh herbs meld with fresh apples and apricot on the palate, with layers upon layers of ever-evolving flavors. This wine also ages super well, so give it a try. Drink now–2030.                      Jeff Porter ",null,Jan D'Amore Wines,"

                      For three generations, the Livon family has farmed the hills of the Collio. The “Manditocai” highlights the grape's lively aromas of white peach, fresh white flowers and crushed stone. The palate of this wine is layered and textured. Aging in Hungarian barriques has given the wine body along with subtle spiced fruit notes.                      Jeff Porter ",Manditocaí,Angelini Wine,"
