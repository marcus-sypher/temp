                      This bottling from a Santa Clara Valley vineyard offers generous aroma of strawberry pie, nutmeg and more baking spices in the deliciously rich nose. There's a brief hit of tannic grip at the tip of the sip, which opens into ripe cherry and space cake flavors.                      Matt Kettmann ",null,null,"

                      A lighter, rusty, almost browning color in the glass, this is a complex bottling that grows more interesting with time. Aromas of dried cherry and white pepper drop into a cranberry, rose petal and cinnamon palate, which is wrapped in a leathery grip.                      Matt Kettmann ",Spear Vineyards,null,"

                      This well-concentrated wine made with native yeast and aged in neutral barrels offers buoyant strawberry and red-plum flavors backed by light tannins and a good, smoky, black-peppery undertone. It is complex, full bodied and ready to enjoy through 2028.                      Jim Gordon ",null,null,"

                      An intensely dark hue in the glass, this bottling from an epic vineyard is jam-packed with spice, offering gingerbread, clove and nutmeg against the berry fruit aromas. The spice is front-and-center on the palate as well, where firm tannins uphold the baked berry fruit elements.                      Matt Kettmann ",Unfamiliar Truth Slide Hill Vineyard,null,"

                      This is a solid example of how cool-climate Grenache shows tremendous intensity rather than going light from ocean influence. Aromas of concentrated plum, graphite, cocoa and latte show on the nose, while the palate, which is wrapped in thicker tannins, unleashes undulating waves of baked fruit, cocoa dust and loamy soil. The pie crust spice adds an approachable finish.                      Matt Kettmann ",null,null,"

5,15%,"Gigondas, Rhône Valley, France",750 ml,Red, France,4/1/2023,"
                      The generous palate of this full-bodied wine is enjoyable now, with notes of fresh figs, raspberries, plums, wild berries, thyme and violets. Grown on cooler parcels, this Grenache is pure and elegant. This beautiful bottling will be hard to stay away from, but cellaring through 2028 to 2030 will reward those who can possibly wait.
