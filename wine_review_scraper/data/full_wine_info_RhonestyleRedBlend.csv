                      This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre grapes is beautiful for its freshness and simplicity, offering plump raspberry and blackberry flavors on a full body with little oak influence and great acid/ripeness balance. Best now through 2028.                      Jim Gordon ",Wine Creek Ranch,null,"

                      Rich and ripe aromas of spicecake, ginger dust and baked berries show on the nose of this blend of 61% Mourvèdre, 22% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 1% Viognier. The palate lands with a suave texture, showing roasted red plum and caramelized fennel bulb flavors.                      Matt Kettmann ",Level 22,null,"

                      This full-bodied wine opens immediately with dill, black pepper spices, dried and fresh cranberries. It is reminiscent of a profile that would also satisfy a Rioja drinker. Dark, lush berries evolve in the glass along with hints of green peppercorns, bay leaf and eucalyptus.                      Anna-Christina Cabrales ",Bois des Mourres,Grape Expectations (CA),"

                      This is a smashing deal every vintage, and this year's blend of 58% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 4% Mourvèdre and 3% Tempranillo doesn't disappoint. Fresh but savory aromas of roasted red fruit and baking spice drop into a tightly wound palate of snappy red currant and light pepper that rides a zippy acidity through the finish.

                      This Amore is love at first sniff. There's this lovely aromatic interplay between blueberry sorbet, lime zest and a sweet, earthy note like marjoram. Blackberries, saline and cigar box flavors rise quickly from the glass. The wine's mouthfeel is surprisingly fresh and crisp, given the alcohol percentage.

                      Warm maple and vanilla aromas lead to ripe and generously spicy flavors of cooked berries and  milk chocolate. Blended from 65% Syrah and 35% Petite Sirah, the wine shows ample oak notes in the aromas and on the palate, where soft tannins and a full body keep it broad and supple.
