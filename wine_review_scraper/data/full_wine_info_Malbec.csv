                      This is maybe what Malbec tastes like when it's not super ripe and oaked out. Aromas of loam, crushed rocks, mushroom and elderberry. There's touches of black cherry in the dry palate, but it's the peppercorn, wild mint and graphite flavors riding the tight weave that make the magic.

                      A fresh floral note of lilacs kicks off this wine's aromatic set, including blueberries, blackcap raspberries and honeycomb. Rich cassis and caffè mocha flavors dominate the palate, with a slightly bitter orange pith note on the long finish. Beautiful acidity with silky tannins.

                      88% Malbec, with 6% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this graceful blend shows off blackberry, honeysuckle, sage and cardamom aromas.

                      Aged in French and American oak, this 100% Malbec shows aromas of blackcap raspberries, pipe tobacco, wet slate and vanillin. The tannins are sturdy, and the mouthfeel is leathery, with flavors like black cherries, black tea and thyme. Meet my new ""go-to"" wine for Barbacoa tacos.

                      Dark wood aromas of mahogany met with dark plum and light cocoa on the nose of this bottling. The palate is dense with roasted plum and elderberry flavors, showing a pleasant grape-y note on the finish.                      Matt Kettmann ",null,null,"
