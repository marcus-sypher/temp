                      This shows a cool profile, featuring notes of licorice and tarragon, underscored by a bracing backbone of acidity, which builds structure and gives this length. It shows lots of energy from start to finish, with a lingering orchard blossom note.                      Aleks Zecevic ",Parcellaire Blanc #1,Field Blend Selections,"

                      This is enticing, evoking notes of dandelion tea and macadamia nut, followed by clementine and white cherry, all linked by vibrant acidity. It is very charming, but with the salty accent on the finish, this is a great wine to pair with seafood and steamed vegetables.

                      Aromatic skin-contact white, displaying an elegant profile and aromas and flavors of orange blossom, Korean pear, dandelion tea and cardamom. It firms up midpalate, so it would be a great match with food. Try with curry or chicken with za'atar spice.                      Aleks Zecevic ",Gemischter Satz Natural,Circo Vino,"

                      This is slightly reduced at first, with a matchstick note that blows off with air to reveal an array of tropical fruits, including papaya, bergamot and lavender notes. Lighter, yet really expressive, with good length on the finish.                      Aleks Zecevic ",Flora,ZRS Wines LLC,"

                      Cloudy in appearance and light on its feet, this shows its idiosyncratic side upfront, but notes of lime  and lemongrass take over, delivering a fresh finish.                      Aleks Zecevic ",Big Nature White,ZRS Wines LLC,"
