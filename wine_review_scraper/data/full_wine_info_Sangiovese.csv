                      The herbaceous and floral nose on this wine also has notes of iron, new bricks, sour plum and sour cherry. Cherry lingers on the palate, swinging into fig and raisin like a chocolate fruit cake, with umami density from well-aged balsamic vinegar. Tannins are softened but hold their structure, and acid carries through a long finish.                      Danielle Callegari ",Gallule Gran Selezione,Vias Imports,"

                      Cherries, strawberries, raspberries, seaweed and soy sauce mingle with the scent of freshly paved road, gun flint and pencil on the nose of this wine. It offers a very cherry palate, with wet stone, white pepper, rose petal and chocolate-covered orange slice. A bright and lively wine, it balances structure with playfulness, and delivers fruit that is mouthfilling without turning velvety.

                      Vanilla, chocolate and cherry set a sweet tone to the nose of this Sangiovese, before opening up to a woodsiness of herbs and soil. The palate maintains the chocolate-cherry notes, with some strawberry, herbs and wet rock. Polished, approachable tannins align with peppy acid in a strong finish.

                      The time spent in amphora is evident on the nose of this wine, which has an earthy, umami nose of bricks, clay, and the salt and sand of mixed soil. Hints of Bing cherry and flowers float up and eventually become more powerful on the palate, underscored by dusty, grippy tannins and plenty of acid. It's a wine that treads the line between rustic and graceful.                      Danielle Callegari ",Variety,Vintus LLC,"

                      The subtle nose on this wine releases oak notes first, then cherries, soy sauce, herbs, pencil shavings and eraser, and finally a little orange peel. Graphite and soil come through on the palate alongside more cherries, orange and dried herbs. Tannins hold their shape but let the fruit speak, while acid cuts right down the tongue.                      Danielle Callegari ",Testamatta,Folio Fine Wine Partners,"

                      The nose on this wine opens with cherry candy and candied orange peel joined by medicinal herbs and underbrush. The palate offers cherry, chocolate, fig and sugar plum. Dusty, gritty tannins and plenty of heat on the backpalate keep things lively.                      Danielle Callegari ",Castello di Volpaia Riserva,Wilson Daniels Ltd,"
