                      Enticing aromas of freshly baked bread and toasted baguette lead to lemon, crisp apple and hints of almond and smoky truffles on the palate. The flavors are subtle, the fizz is fine textured and the overall expression shows wonderful maturity and complexity. This rare, recently disgorged wine made from predominantly Chardonnay will drink best through 2030.                      Jim Gordon ",Joy!,null,"

                      This bone-dry, mineral-rich wine will start conversations and pair well with lots of fish and shellfish. Racy acidity, a tangy texture and light but bracing body are its hallmarks. Built for further aging, it should drink best from 2025–2035.

                      Fragrant butter and almond aromas lead to a nicely rounded texture, lively bubbles, green apple and ginger flavors in this light-bodied, elegant wine.                      Jim Gordon ",Étoile Brut,null,"

                      Aged four years on its lees and disgorged in March 2022, this 79% Pinot Noir and 21% Chardonnay blend is frothy fun. Its aromas of wild strawberries, honey and hyacinth form a heady perfume. The wine's smooth, almost creamy texture delivers flavors such as bright red cherries and white-peach olive-oil cake.                      Michael Alberty ",Mineral Springs Brut Rosé,null,"

                      This 60-40 blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is made from the 2012 Vintage Brut base wine, which aged on its lees for an additional seven years before disgorgement. Elegant little bubbles and lively acidity lead the way to aromas and flavors of white peach, wet rocks and lemon Bundt cake.                      Michael Alberty ",Extended Tirage Brut,null,"
