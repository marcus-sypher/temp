                      The unforgettable vineyard of Monte Xisto in the upper Douro has produced a fine, richly ripe wine. Its tannins and powerful black fruits are well integrated, bringing out a mineral texture and saline edge. This is an impressive vineyard that has given a beautifully structured wine. Drink from 2026. Organic.                      Roger Voss ",null,Kestrel Vintners,"

                      A wine from two parcels, one of Touriga Nacional, the other from a field blend, this is impressively rich and dense. With a year in new wood, the wine is powerful, with juicy blackberry fruits and solid tannins, all suggesting it needs further aging. Drink from 2025.

                      This limited production Reserva is a dense wine, with the perfumed wildness of this remote estate. Richly textured and with dark fruits as well as acidity, the wine is still so youthful. Drink from 2026.                      Roger Voss ",Reserva,Vias Imports,"

                      Named after Francisca van Zeller, daughter of Cristiano van Zeller whose family home is Vale D. Maria, the wine comes from a single plot of old vines. It is a powerful wine with great density and simultaneously serious richness. The wine deserves further aging. Wait to drink until 2026.

                      This is classic: more than 20 grape varieties from 11 acres. The result is a powerfully structured wine. The tannins and the wine's concentration are still young after four years. This impressive wine's richness and intensity will soften over the next months, years so don't hurry and drink from 2024.                      Roger Voss ",Vinha da Micaela,Shiverick Imports,"

                      A mature, splendidly perfumed wine, this is a blend of half Touriga Nacional and half Syrah. Barrel fermented and wood aged for 3.5 years, the wine is polished and rich. It is an impressive wine, ready to drink now.                      Roger Voss ",Grande Reserva,Bonhomie Wine Imports,"
