                      This wine opens with upfront aromas of cherry in all of its forms: ripe, tart, red, black, and dried. Around that dense core of cherry aromas, there are subtle notes of dried flowers and mixed spices. The palate is quite forward for a young cru Barolo with the juicy cherry flavors at its center. Hints of licorice and chalk dance around the edges of the wine with supple tannins and moderate acidity on the finish.                      Jeff Porter ",Cerretta,Ste. Michelle Wine Estates,"
