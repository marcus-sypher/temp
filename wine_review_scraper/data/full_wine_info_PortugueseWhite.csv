                      There are only a few acres of Terrantez left in the world, almost entirely on the Madeira island. This magnificent wood-aged wine is perfumed, ripe with wood-aging tannins and a bite from the spirit, and so generous and smooth at the end. Drink now. Tasted 375ml.

                      With a good dose of creamy Encruzado that is freshened by Bical, this wine is well balanced and deliciously textured. Aging in wood for nine months has given the wine a broad character, open and generous. The texture takes its cue from Dão granite, offering minerality as a contrast to the fruit. Drink the wine now.                      Roger Voss ",Taboadella Grande Villae,Farah Trading Co,"

                      This rich, wood-aged wine offers layers of white fruits, minerality and spice. The field blend of old vines gives concentration to the ripe fruits. Drink from 2024.                      Roger Voss ",CV Curriculum Vitae,MS Walker,"

                      This wine is named after an arch in the Aguieira manor house. It has good acidity and spice from wood aging. Balanced with citrus and white fruits set against a rounded texture, the wine is ready to drink.                      Roger Voss ",Arco d'Aguieira,Aveleda Inc,"

                      This wine is lightly wood aged, giving spice and structure to the ripe white fruits. Still young, the wine bursts with energy that will calm down. Drink from later this year.                      Roger Voss ",Castello d'Alba Reserva,MS Walker,"

                      A ripe, spicy wood-aged wine, this is rich and creamy. Apple flavors are filled out with toastiness and lifted by acidity and structure. Thie wine is ready to drink.                      Roger Voss ",Quinta do Mondeco Munda Encruzado,EcoValley,"
