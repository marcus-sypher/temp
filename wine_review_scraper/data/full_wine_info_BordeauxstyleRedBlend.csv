                      Smoked red fruit and red spice aromas make for a very dry nose on this blend of 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 1% Merlot. There's a leathery texture to the palate, where dried meat and cherry compote flavors compete for attention, as cinnamon spices up the long finish. Drink now-2039.

                      This Cabernet Sauvignon with 5% Merlot is graceful and balanced like a Flying Wallenda. Red cherry and flaky pie crust aromas, along with a hint of pipe tobacco, fill the air. Black cherry and graphite flavors are fantastic, but the wine's sleek mouthfeel and silky tannins steal the showâ€”a must-try.                      Michael Alberty ",Reserve,null,"

                      Baked blackberry, leather, cocoa and espresso-bean aromas show on the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Malbec and 17% Petit Verdot. The palate is generous in fruit, tense in tannins and very approachable, showing creamy blueberry, pepper and wild-herb flavors.                      Matt Kettmann ",Ancestor,null,"

                      This wine's label refresh comes with a more focused blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec inside but a similarly fair price.. Baked plum, nutmeg and more barrel-spice aromas are well integrated on the nose. Chiseled tannins frame a palate of fresh red-fruit-jam flavors, along with cardamom and mace spices.                      Matt Kettmann ",Cirque Du Vin,null,"

                      Dense in the glass and dry on the nose, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc offers leather, dried meat, charcoal and blackberry aromas. A cigar box flavor runs through the palate, which also offers baked red fruit, anise and gingerbread flavors.                      Matt Kettmann ",Whipper-in Estate,null,"

Bright strawberry flavors are spiced by cinnamon and sumac on the lively (rather than brooding) palate.                      Matt Kettmann ",Nikiara,null,"
