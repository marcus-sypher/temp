0,13%,"Walla Walla Valley (WA), Columbia Valley, Washington, US",750 ml,Red, US,5/1/2023,"
                      Made with fruit from Les Collines Vineyard, this breathtaking Syrah is balanced, with elevated acidity, plush tannins and restrained alcohol. Aromas and flavors of blackberries, saline, hibiscus flowers, black pepper and an almond croissant dazzle. Easily one of the best wines I tasted in 2022.

                      Few things are more distinctive than a zesty style of Syrah, as evidenced in this blend of the Nelson and Gali vineyards. Brisk, snappy and fresh aromas of smashed acai and blackberry lead into a texturally complex palate of refreshing, tart fruit, boosted by ample pepper and herb notes.

2,14%,"Russian River Valley, Sonoma, California, US",750 ml,Red, US,5/1/2023,"
                      This cool-climate wine tastes like it came the northern Rhone Valley, offering earthy, peppery overtones and deep, concentrated black currants and blackberries. Its moderate tannins are well-matched by a rich texture that extends the fruit into a lingering finish. Best through 2030.                      Jim Gordon ",Don Miguel Vineyard Estate Grown,null,"

                      Lush aromas of purple flowers and freshly smashed plums are fresh while rich on the nose of this bottling, which is layered in mace and cinnamon spices. Gingerbread and star anise flavors surrounded the baked plum and berry elements of the rich palate.                      Matt Kettmann ",Spanish Springs Vineyard,null,"

                      Fresh aromas of red currant, red apple and light bay leaf show on the nose of this immediately likable and still young bottling. The palate is zippy in acidity and loaded with lively flavors of raspberry and white pepper.                      Matt Kettmann ",Hinnrichs Vineyard,null,"

                      Intense aromas of black plum and fresh flowers meet with tar and iodine on the nuanced nose of this bottling. The palate balances purple fruit and flowers flavors with the more rugged dried kelp and asphalt elements.                      Matt Kettmann ",Estate,null,"
