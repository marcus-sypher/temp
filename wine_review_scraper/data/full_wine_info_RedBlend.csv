                      This is no ""baby."" This bold, rich Cabernet Sauvignon-driven blend has grown-up elegance, from its aromas of dewberries, dark raspberries, saline and rose petals, to its Mikhail Baryshnikov-like balance. In between, look for flavors like blackberry fruit jellies, thyme and dark chocolate.                      Michael Alberty ",Bear Cub,null,"

                      This is a winning Super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, starting with the pleasantly reserved aromas of roasted strawberry on the subtle nose. The palate adds caramel dust and oak spice to that red fruit core, making for a very versatile bottling.                      Matt Kettmann ",Patria,null,"

                      Lush aromas of raspberry jam and licorice dust show on the nose of this blend of 61% Syrah, 30% Graciano and 9% Grenache.

                      Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc unite to create a flavorful wine with a lithe body, smooth tannins and pucker-worthy acidity. Aromas of blackberries, orange peel and fir needles are followed by Arnold Palmer-like flavors of raspberries, lemonade and black tea. This is delicious stuff.

                      This Cabernet Franc-driven estate blend spent 18 months in 100% new French oak. Bright, fresh aromas of mulberries and citrus are followed by notes of dried fig. A sweet blackberry flavor dominates the palate, joined by orange slices and wet rocks. Silky tannins and a juicy mouthfeel.                      Michael Alberty ",Collector's Society Red Wine,null,"

                      Created by assistant winemaker Jackson Dwelley, this blend of 70% Tempranillo and 30% Grenache is a wise combination for this terroir. Aromas of dried cherry, fennel pollen and cola drop into a palate of baked berry and minty sage.                      Matt Kettmann ",Jackson's Blend,null,"
