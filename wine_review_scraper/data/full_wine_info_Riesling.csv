                      This intensely mineral version shows a light golden hue, which hints at concentration, but its acidity makes it incredibly graceful. Integration of elements is seamless and its lively profile is decorated with rich flavors of melon, clementine and peach that are sprinkled with meringue and fleur de sel. The succulent, mouthwatering finish flows across the palate, inviting you for another sip. Best from 2025 through 2045.                      Aleks Zecevic ",Ried Achleiten Smaragd,Winebow Imports,"

                      This is the absolute showstopper for a classic Riesling expression. It is a very expressive, medium-bodied version, with lots of flesh, offset by mouthwatering acidity that gives this ample energy and drive. Notes of elderflower, jasmine, yellow plum and kumquat impart charm midpalate, while hints of cardamom and orange blossom linger on the long finish. Best from 2025 through 2045.

                      This is an epiphany of elegance embodied in a Wachau Riesling. It features seductive tropical notes, with citrus and juicy mango at the core, while its acidity cuts through, providing energy and support.

                      This is enticing, capturing your attention from the first sniff. It features an exotic, tropical, fruit cast to the apricot and passion fruit flavors, with laser-precise acidity. It is really its mineral backbone that plumbs the depth, supported by the supple texture. Best after 2025.                      Aleks Zecevic ",Laubenheimer St. Remigiusberg Trocken,Tri-Vin Imports,"

                      Silky and refined with a rich, minerally essence to the peach and yellow apple flavors. It is still unevolved with super silky texture and good harmony between its richness and vibrant acidity. It needs time, but can be enjoyed now with a dessert. Best after 2028.

                      This offers an engaging floral aroma on the nose, while the palate feature razor-sharp acidity underscoring the flavors of lemon curd, quince and savory herb. Notes of dried apple and spice prime the finish. It is powerful and complex, but it needs several years to integrate fully. Best after 2026.
